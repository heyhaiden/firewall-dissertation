# Firewall Scout: Digital Defensible Space for Fire Severity Indexing

## Overview
The Firewall Scout project is a research initiative aimed at enhancing environmental monitoring and fire risk management within the UK's urban-rural interface (URI). This project introduces the concept of a "digital defensible space" - a protective barrier formed by a network of sensors that continuously monitor and analyze environmental variables contributing to fire risk. The goal is to enable precise assessment of potential fire hazards by generating a higher fidelity Fire Severity Index (FSI), thereby strengthening preventive measures and enhancing community resilience.

## Key Features
- **Firewall Scout Device:** A low-cost device designed to monitor environmental factors contributing to heatwave-induced fire events.
- **Sensor Network:** A combination of a cost-effective sensor network and participatory sensing to enhance wildfire risk determination.
- **Digital Defensible Space:** A modern take on the traditional "defensible space" concept, leveraging technology for fire risk management.

## Research Objectives
- Develop a low-cost sensing device to monitor environmental factors contributing to wildfire events.
- Assess the enhancement of wildfire detection and risk modeling in the UK's URI using a low-cost sensor network combined with participatory sensing.

## Technical Details

### Scout Node Design
- **Sensor Selection:** The BME688 sensor was chosen for its ability to measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas resistance. It demonstrated superior performance in dynamic conditions.
- **Hardware Components:** The Firewall Scout node operates on an Arduino MKRWAN 1310 with LoRaWAN connectivity. It's powered by a 3.7V 1000mAh rechargeable lithium polymer battery and optimized for ultra-low power usage.
- **Enclosure:** Components are housed in an IP65-rated plastic enclosure, ensuring weatherproof integrity. A custom-designed Stevenson screen model ensures adequate airflow for the sensor while protecting it from UV rays and direct sunlight.

### Arduino Libraries
- **BSEC Library:** Initially used for the BME688 sensor, this library from Bosch provides raw data readings and offers several power modes. However, due to compatibility issues, its use was discontinued.
- **Adafruit Library:** This library was employed for the development of a low-power version of the Scout node.

### Repository Contents
- **Code:** Reproducible code for the Firewall Scout project.
- **Sensor Calibration:** Calibration details for the sensors used.
- **Enclosure Designs:** Custom designs for the device enclosure.
- **Data:** Collected data used in the study.

## Deployment & Data Collection
Three Scout nodes were deployed in Kingâ€™s Lynn and Stratford. They were programmed to send data packets over a ten-minute duty cycle via LoRa radio to The Things Network (TTN). Data was collected in an InfluxDB database, hosted on a Raspberry Pi. Dashboards were constructed within InfluxDB and Grafana for data interpretation and visualization.

## Conclusion
The Firewall Scout project represents a significant step forward in the field of environmental monitoring and fire risk management. By leveraging technology, this research aims to provide a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of fire risks, ultimately contributing to safer and more resilient communities.
